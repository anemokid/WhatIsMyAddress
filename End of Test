## I think I came halfway in completing this app to its entirety. 
- I felt I was familiar with building the user interface of this app, also I was comftorable writing 
  code that sent one intent from a activity to a different one. 
  - I was also familiar with creating new activities. 
  - I felt that I didn't know Recylcer View well, and that is something I need to review in the future. 
 - I was familiar with creating the model data and all the classes fro the recycler view. It was just implements
 SharedpPreferences that messed me up.
